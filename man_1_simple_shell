 simple_shell -` hsh`
- command line interpreter or shell


## .SH SYNOPSIS

  .`/hsh`
 (no options yet)



## .SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell is a command line interpreter, or shell, in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson. This shell is intentionally minimalistic, yet includes the basic functionality of a traditional Unix-like command line interface. simple_shell is desgined to run on the linux environment.


## .SH OVERVIEW

Reading from either the terminal or files, simple_shell interprets and executes commands.


.B Invocation
.in +2n
\fBhsh\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBhsh\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBhsh\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBhsh\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.

Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, \fBhsh\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.
.B hsh\fR runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.
